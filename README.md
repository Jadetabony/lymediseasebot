# lymediseasebot

The bot monitors Twitter to find tweets with #Lyme or #LymeDisease. It stores the authors' information in an SQLite database--including their screen name, name, number of followers and friends, total number of tweets--for later use. It counts up the number of lyme disease related tweets by each author and stores that number as well, starting from when the bot was initialized.
